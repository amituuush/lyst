// _____________________________________________

// In addition to reading the state, container components can dispatch actions.

//In a similar fashion, you can define a function called 'mapDispatchToProps' that receives the 'dispatch()' method and returns callback props that you want to inject into the presentational component

// callback props are being handed down to the presentational components, so when a user clicks or interacts with your application, it fires the callback prop, which is the dispatch method that fires the action off according to the user action

// `handlers` should comprise of all the user related events in my app? (clearList, addItem, removeItem) And all be passed to `mapDispatchToProps`, which eventually injects those handlers as props into `<ToDoList>`, which are then passed down to presentational components?

// then when the form is submitted or a delete item button is clicked, you just call the callback and let your reducers handle the changes

// after the changes happen, `App` will update with the new redux state, causing `ToDoList` to rerender. React will figure out what the new view is supposed to look like and make the required changes to the DOM

    return () => {
        if (store.getState().items.length > 0) {

            }

const mapStateToProps = (state) => {
    return state
}

// App component is created by the function returned from redux-reactâ€™s `connect`
// It holds the state from the store and passes those as `props` to the `ToDoList` component

const App = ReactRedux.connect(
    mapStateToProps,
    mapDispatchToProps

// store = {
//   dispatch: function(action) {
//     this.state = appReducer(this.state, action)
//   }
// }

 // takes return value from clearItems(), which is the action (object), and passes it to the dispatch method (redux method on store).

// the action that goes into dispatch function gets passed as the second argument to the reducer. See example below:
